# TODO #

### Map building ###

- trim edge lines back, deal with densely clustered line segments
- cul-de-sac handling in p2
- pregraph3 vs final graph structure?
- whats the purpose of phase 2 now?
- deal with disconnected things properly
- document stuff, code-freeze on mapgen!

### UI ###

- get everything old working again
  - drawing turns (better)
  - menu items do stuff
  - config
  - keyboarding
- figure out why broken_angle and y inversion everywhere still...
- way better pruning of what to (re-draw) using quadtrees
  - but is it even needed?
- oneways look wretched

### Scalaisms ###

- figure out if all those coordinate copies are necessary... thinking not.
- use ListBuffers more.
- make things like points lists immutable, so slicing is maybe more efficient?
- reduce more vars to vals
- improve build system (dont recompile)
- Edges as subclasses for direxn might be nice
- explicitly override hashcode?
