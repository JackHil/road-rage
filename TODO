# TODO #

### Map building ###

1 osm now does include info on num of lanes!
  - if its not a oneway, total?

2 lines arent deterministic?! small floating pt variation...


- make line segs meet up better.
- style: xml out could be string.format or xml and then stringify
- cul-de-sac handling in p2... needed?
  - Claus Circle in BR... has no outgoing turns.
- pregraph3 vs final graph structure?
- deal with disconnected things properly
- multi-lane situations dont have enough turns, and we need to do more trimming!
- scc removal appears broken in Houston?
- document stuff, code-freeze on mapgen!

### Wards ###

- whats broken with mikes?
  - length
  - overall strategy
  - semantics of one of the set operations
- find 'major' roads better
  - crosses/links major roads
  - manually editing
  - update osm (scripts!)
- my wards!
  - guarantee some kind of connectedness within a ward
  - deal with the small roads that cut through?

### UI ###

- show routes better
- conflicts dont look correct
- config
- menu items doing stuff
- oneways look wretched
- make it look nicer
  - UI polishing
  - black road backgrounds dont meet up smoothly since we go by line segment
    - add extra lanes on either side, dont color them white, but draw the stuff in between?
- figure out why broken_angle and y inversion everywhere still...
- way better pruning of what to (re-draw) using quadtrees
  - but is it even needed?
- keyboard-grabbing focus is... greedy when minimized
- dont show arrows when line segs are really clustered

### Agents ###

- old static behavior
  - lack of determinism?
    - timesteps matter / crossing many things in one hop
      - if an agent can only adjust speed once per timestep... oops.
    - patho case: two lanes merging, agent on each, order matters.

  - detect collisions
    - post-mortem checker still misses scary things in between, like when merging.
    - force collisions, see if they're detected. set one guy on the road and make him be still!
    - conflicting simultaneous turns
    - ui show collisions

  - ... motivate reactive solution: avoid collisions!
    - enforce speed limits
    - test with stalled car

- lanechanging model
- spawning safely
- delegate pricy work to a thread pool
- spawning specifically in UI
- allow accel control too
- dimensions to the cars

### Scalaisms ###

- move all configable things to Util
- use ListBuffers more.
- make more immutable things
- reduce more vars to vals
- improve build system (dont recompile)
- Edges as subclasses for direxn might be nice
- make everything possible immutable, but then have to figure out how to build
  inter-referential things
  - Mutable subclasses of everything used during construction..
  - have more ids and methods that access based on those. that'll break it.
- explicitly override hashcode?

### Simulation ###

- tolling
- lane reversal
- 4-way stops
- traffic signals
- dynamic traffic signals
- spawning realistic traffic patterns
