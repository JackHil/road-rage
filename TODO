# TODO #

### Map building ###

- lanes go the wrong way, often -- dont trust the trig, bro.
- improve turn heuristics
- trim edge lines back

- tarjan's scc removal (just see 315 proj9)
- cul-de-sac handling in p2
- pregraph3 vs final graph structure?
- whats the purpose of phase 2 now?

### Scala ###

- figure out if all those coordinate copies are necessary... thinking not.
- use ListBuffers more.
- make things like points lists immutable, so slicing is maybe more efficient?
- reduce more vars to vals
