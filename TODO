# TODO #

### Map building ###

- deal with densely clustered line segments
- cul-de-sac handling in p2... needed?
- pregraph3 vs final graph structure?
- deal with disconnected things properly
- multi-lane situations dont have enough turns, and we need to do more trimming!
- scc removal appears broken in Houston?
- lines arent deterministic?!
- document stuff, code-freeze on mapgen!

### Wards ###

- whats broken with mikes?
  - length
  - overall strategy
  - semantics of one of the set operations
- try mine
  - find 'major' roads better
    - lots of verts
    - crosses/links major roads
    - manually editing
  - guarantee some kind of connectedness within a ward

### UI ###

- conflicts dont look correct
- config
- menu items doing stuff
- oneways look wretched
- make it look nicer
  - UI polishing
  - black road backgrounds dont meet up smoothly since we go by line segment
    - add extra lanes on either side, dont color them white, but draw the stuff in between?
- figure out why broken_angle and y inversion everywhere still...
- way better pruning of what to (re-draw) using quadtrees
  - but is it even needed?
- keyboard-grabbing focus is... greedy when minimized

### Agents ###

- a dumb behavior to move to end of lane and disappear/go to next edge
- physics... start with velocity, have (de)acceleration
- actual agent queue semantics, spawning them safely
- old static behavior
- spawning specifically in UI

### Scalaisms ###

- move all configable things to Util
- use ListBuffers more.
- make more immutable things
- reduce more vars to vals
- improve build system (dont recompile)
- Edges as subclasses for direxn might be nice
- make everything possible immutable, but then have to figure out how to build
  inter-referential things
  - have more ids and methods that access based on those. that'll break it.
- explicitly override hashcode?
