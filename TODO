# TODO #

### Map building ###

- trim edge lines back, deal with densely clustered line segments
- cul-de-sac handling in p2
- pregraph3 vs final graph structure?
- whats the purpose of phase 2 now?
- deal with disconnected things properly
- document stuff, code-freeze on mapgen!

### UI ###

- get everything old working again
  - drawing turns (better)
  - keyboarding
  - config
  - menu items do stuff
- oneways look wretched
- support neighborhoods again
- make it look nicer
- figure out why broken_angle and y inversion everywhere still...
- way better pruning of what to (re-draw) using quadtrees
  - but is it even needed?

### Scalaisms ###

- move all configable things to Util
- figure out if all those coordinate copies are necessary... thinking not.
- use ListBuffers more.
- make more immutable things
- reduce more vars to vals
- improve build system (dont recompile)
- Edges as subclasses for direxn might be nice
  - make everything possible immutable, but then have to figure out how to build
    inter-referential things
  - have more ids and methods that access based on those. that'll break it.
- explicitly override hashcode?
