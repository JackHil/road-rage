# TODO #

1) find scenarios that dont deadlock, write results section
  - run the same scenario a few times with a couple of seeds
    but when comparing, exact same demand data
2) rework first 3 sections

paper:
  - mention "how many agents can be comfortably simulated in realtime"
    - fix the dumb illegal entry epsilon bugs.
      - why was the hack in map.make.Checker needed?
      - a conflict between a too-big stopping distance and acceleration into negative speed...
        - suggests it was an impossible request anyway?

      - directly compute the accel to end in dist.
      - lookahead by end_thres more than current.
      - why are we EVER doomed?!
      - why are we EVER requesting negative accel_to_end distances?

    - ... then crank up dt and get a good number.

  - reference gridlock paper.
  - sections
    - abstract
    - intro
    - related work
      - compare to MATsim some more
    - results

  - diagrams
    - map model

  - proofread / clean passive voice
  - name could either rework AORTA or be japanese

- find specific scenarios that don't deadlock
  - a way to save a "scenario"

code: get signals a fair contender to stop signs
  - measurements
    - how many agents active at any time? (when continuous gen is going) (poll max every min)
    - process it: care about per-agent and per-intersection totals/averages/variances
      - then make sure stuff like reservation pre-emption helps!

code: seemingly unavoidable gridlock... agents locking edges, not verts.
  - detect with dependency graph
    - be clever: not between agents, but between lanes.
    - incorporate optimizations when speed=0
  - make them re-route?
  - can we avoid with better A*ing? feels like dumb routes are being chosen.
    - but then it's still always possible...
    - lack of lane-changing is to blame!

- rename lanes/intersections/junctions in code too? at least everywhere in paper consistently.

- set up website / good build instructions / code licenses
  - osm scraper script

###################

TRAFFIC SIGNAL
  - random allocation policy
  - visualize the green/red better
    - do something with lanes still
    - what i was imagining was picking some edge at some point in time, then flooding out
      from there at some rate.
  - improve/clean up greenflood
  - diffused backwards allocation
    - same idea, but goal: make one critical intersection super efficient
    - what lanes lead to / feed the lanes that can do turns? repeat for those.

BUGS
  - (50,000; drunken behavior; BTR; seed 1330434688570; time ~18.6) illegal entry by a2192
    (possibly the epsilon issue again)

PROFILING
  - we can do much better with ready agents... max capacity of edges, group them based on where they
    want to spawn, maybe by generator?
  - measure profiling things
    - how long did simulation run? (one value)
  *** in react if speed is still 0, see if follow_agent or intersection has changed.

  1) is caching properties of linked list hurting us for iterating through big things?
  3) ... increase dt, of course
  4) optimize step/react -- those take the most work time
    - remember what agent we're following and what intersection we're waiting on
      if both havent changed, short-circuit

GENERATORS
  - a way to turn them off / reap them in the UI
  - color agents from diff generators a certain way
  - a way to save a "scenario"

BIGGER ISSUES
  - fix geom of edge lines
  - make sure turns and conflicts are as good as possible
    - randomize num of lanes to test
  * lane changing
    - logically, geometrically
    - when is it safe?
      - dont try it too close to the end
      - guarantee to avoid agents
      - atomic; dont start without finishing
      - dont attempt on short lanes
    - how does the agent look during it?
      - how long does it take? is it a fxn of speed?
      - stay in both queues during
    - how are routes affected if it's missed/impossible?
  - is there a way to analytically say "an agent will own this chunk" at some time, and then solve
    for collisions?
  - nondeterministic.
    - when running, agents enter at diff times
    - when paused, threads compute routes in diff orders, then two agents compete to spawn in same
      spot.
  - automated testing strategy.
  - contraction hierarchies for FAST pathing, or wards
  - group crazy intersections together and have S-turns.
    - relatedly, have a notion of "I'm done with the turn, but I'm protruding into the intersection"
      by requiring not only we're done with a turn but also some dist along the new edge.

POSSIBLY SIMPLE
  - "S turns" when osm ID matches up?
  - slow down for turns (a speed limit)
  - follow dist variable based on speed, so when a light goes green,
    everyone starts simultaneously
  - tweak cfg now that we have meters
  - script to scrape osm
  - switch ant to sbt? https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Examples
  - when we speed up, sleep less in UI?
  - ui configurable intersection policies
  - snapshot mode in headless with agents pos, to later render
  - improve pre-emption in stop lights + reservation policies. agent in front of them better be
    approved too.

### Map building ###

- our pruning of pedestrian ways seems to be a bit too enthusiastic (see Guadalupe St)
- deterministic construction is still wonky, with both ward IDs and lines (due to meeting up)
- make line segs meet up better.
- style: xml out could be string.format or xml and then stringify, or use lazy?
- cul-de-sac handling in p2... needed?
  - Claus Circle in BR... has no outgoing turns.
- pregraph3 vs final graph structure?
- multi-lane situations dont have enough turns, and we need to do more trimming!
- lane reversal
  1) Traversable.location starts from the other end (distances, queues all stay same)
  2) dynamically recalculating turns

### Wards ###

- whats broken with mikes?
  - length
  - overall strategy
  - semantics of one of the set operations
- find 'major' roads better
  - crosses/links major roads
  - manually editing
  - update osm (scripts!)
- my wards!
  - guarantee some kind of connectedness within a ward
  - except in vs out edges to the whole neighborhood?
- play with min span trees for pathing

### UI ###

- in sugarland, oneway bg lines arent thick enough
- get rid of arrows, make roads transparent, change colors, something.
- show 'fps' in viewer
- agents in middle of road makes ends of lines once again look sucky.
- show agents who are currently GOING
  - ui could show policy's current owner or something
- show routes better
- config
- menu items doing stuff
- make it look nicer
  - UI polishing
  - black road backgrounds dont meet up smoothly since we go by line segment
    - add extra lanes on either side, dont color them white, but draw the stuff in between?
- way better pruning of what to (re-draw) using quadtrees
  - but is it even needed?
- dont show arrows when line segs are really clustered
- draw the orig corner of freehanded polygons differently or something

### Agents ###

- post-mortem queue checker still misses scary things in between, like when merging.
- lots of things break if we have a vertex with a self-loop
- make them slow down for turns
- lanechanging model
- spawning specifically in UI
- structuring policy stuff as a state machine and events may be more elegant...
- give lanes/roads/etc the ability to be closed
- we could check less queues atomically if we could step agents in some cool order
  - or when we mess with an agent, see if they've moved yet this round?

### Scalaisms ###

- move all configable things to Util
- use ListBuffers more.
- make more immutable things
- reduce more vars to vals
- make everything possible immutable, but then have to figure out how to build
  inter-referential things
  - Mutable subclasses of everything used during construction..
  - have more ids and methods that access based on those. that'll break it.
- explicitly override hashcode?

### Simulation ###

- tolling (not trolling)
- lane reversal
- traffic signals
- dynamic traffic signals
- spawning realistic traffic patterns
