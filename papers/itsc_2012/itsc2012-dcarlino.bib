  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles have seen great advancements in recent years, and such
vehicles are now closer than ever to being commercially available. The advent of
driverless cars provides opportunities for optimizing traffic in ways not
possible before. This paper introduces an open source multiagent microscopic
traffic simulator called AORTA, which stands for Approximately
Orchestrated Routing and Transportation Analyzer, designed for optimizing
autonomous traffic at a city-wide scale. AORTA creates scale simulations of the
real world by generating maps using publicly available road data from
OpenStreetMap (OSM). This allows simulations to be set up through
AORTA for a desired region anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes. AORTA
allows for traffic optimization by creating intelligent behaviors for
individual driver agents and intersection policies to be followed by these
agents. These behaviors and policies define how agents interact with one
another, control when they cross intersections, and route agents to their
destination. This paper demonstrates a simple application using AORTA through
an experiment testing intersection policies at a city-wide scale.},
