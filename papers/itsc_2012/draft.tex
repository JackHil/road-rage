% what are our goals with this paper?
% * demonstrate use of OSM and motivate more data collection
% * present a simulation framework
% * present a pretty naive static planning
% * motivate and demonstrate wards for hierarchial planning (but also reasoning
%    about congestion)

% contribution: autonomous car / human car sim on EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE

\section{Map Construction from OSM}

each step

limitations

proposals to change OSM to fix these issues

integrating with what other sources for spawning traffic, placing POI?


\section{Simulation}

limitations of timesteps and small edges. in reality, more computational power
and more reactivity

justify arbitrary constants, like deaccel for cars
