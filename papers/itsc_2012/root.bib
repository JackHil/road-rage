        Artificial intelligence research is ushering in a new era of
        sophisticated, mass-market transportation technology.  While computers
        can already fly a passenger jet better than a trained human pilot,
        people are still faced with the dangerous yet tedious task of driving
        automobiles. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the field that
        focuses on integrating information technology with vehicles and
        transportation infrastructure to make transportation safer, cheaper, and
        more efficient.  Recent advances in ITS point to a
        future in which vehicles themselves handle the vast majority of the
        driving task.  Once autonomous vehicles become popular, autonomous
        interactions amongst \emph{multiple} vehicles will be possible.  Current
        methods of vehicle coordination, which are all designed to work with
        human drivers, will be outdated.  The bottleneck for roadway
        efficiency will no longer be the drivers, but rather the mechanism by
        which those drivers' actions are coordinated. While open-road driving
        is a well-studied and more-or-less-solved problem, urban traffic
        scenarios, especially intersections, are much more challenging.
        We believe current methods for controlling traffic, specifically at
        intersections, will not be able to take advantage of the increased
        sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles as compared to human
        drivers. In this article, we suggest an alternative mechanism for
        coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through intersections.
        Drivers and intersections in this mechanism are treated as autonomous agents
        in a multiagent system. In this multiagent system, intersections use a new
        reservation-based approach built around a detailed communication protocol,
        which we also present. We demonstrate in simulation that our new mechanism
        has the potential to significantly outperform current intersection control
        technology---traffic lights and stop signs. Because our mechanism can
        emulate a traffic light or stop sign, it subsumes the most popular current
        methods of intersection control. This article also presents two extensions
        to the mechanism. The first extension allows the system to control
        human-driven vehicles in addition to autonomous vehicles. The second gives
        priority to emergency vehicles without significant cost to civilian
        vehicles. The mechanism, including both extensions, is implemented and
        tested in simulation, and we present experimental results that strongly
        attest to the efficacy of this approach.
