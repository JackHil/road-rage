benefits:
  - another benefit... if queue does error checking against old state of queue,
    does that help? (i think not...)

thoughts:
  - characterizing where everything is is easy, capturing internal state is hard
  - characterize evertyhing that happens that causes state change, make it
    undoable.


CHECKPOINTING
  - trigger it auomatically, right filenames
  - efficient format, but converters btwn human-readable
  - hard to save rng, so reset seed before checkpointing
  - scala auto-serialization, ad-hoc, collect state?
