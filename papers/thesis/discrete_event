MATSim gets orders of magnitude speedup by simulating discrete events rather
than discrete time-steps. They define "interesting" occurrences as cars entering
or leaving a link, so there's not a need to simulate/interpolate movement on the
links in between. Instead, they can find the next time a car will generate an
interesting movement and jump much more than a fixed 0.1s time-step much of the
time. This queue model neglects the details of lane-changing and includes extra
mechanisms to model the shockwave delay effect of stopped cars beginning to
start.

It'd be great to get a similar speedup in AORTA, but without compromising the
simplicity of a microscopic, agent-based simulation with the complexity and
inaccuracy of a queue model. In principle, layering a meseoscopic simulation
(because removing detail amounts to losing microscopicness) could be done, and
even combined with microsimulation to interpolate when needed?


    - in GUI, have to interpolate positions?
    - equivalent to just choosing large time-step?
    - mixed time-steps... (minus lanechanging)
      - front of queue doesnt care about anything, his time-step can bring him
        to intersection
      - maybe all behind the front all get the same jump?
      - but that could neglect wave/crunch effects...
      - and lanechanging hard to simulate!
    - at time t, vehicles with expected < t are chugging along, >= are queued at
      the end
